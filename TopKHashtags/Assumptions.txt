1)Input values of K and Window size are dynamic and depends on the user.

2)The window size is in terms of tweets. For eg: window size of 100 means the sliding window is of 100 tweets and the output of top K hashtags will be generated after every 100 tweets.

3)Tweets with no hashtags have been discarded i.e tweets with atleast one hashtag is considered.

4)Only tweets in English Language are being sampled and taken into consideration.

5)At the initial execution of the program, the output of top K hashtags is generated only when tweet count reaches the window size and continues.

6)If the user enters any invalid inputs(i.e negative nummbers, characters or alphabets) as input values for K and window size an error message will appear displaying that input should be only in numeric form and greater than zero

7)After the user enters the input and starts streaming he is not allowed to change the input until he presses the stop button.
